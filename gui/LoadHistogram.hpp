/*
 * LoadHistogram.hpp — a rolling DSP-load history graph for the Monitor tab.
 *
 * Each pushed sample (load in [0, 1]) adds a column at the right edge; older
 * samples scroll left.  Bars are colour-coded green/amber/red by level, the
 * current value is shown as text, and when no audio is active the history
 * freezes (dimmed) behind a "waiting for audio..." overlay.
